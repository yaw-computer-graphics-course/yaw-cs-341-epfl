<h3 id="feature-1-procedurally-generated-texture">Feature 1 :
Procedurally Generated Texture</h3>
<h4 id="implementation">Implementation</h4>
<p>To achieve a realistic flame effect in our scene, we used procedural
generation techniques to create both the flame’s mesh and texture. This
approach allows for a dynamic visual representation that simulates the
behavior of real flames.</p>
<p><strong>-&gt; Mesh Generation and Noise Functions:</strong> <br></p>
<p>The flame mesh is generated using the <code>fire_build_mesh</code>
function, which takes into account a height map, a base flame level, and
a time parameter. The height map defines the shape of the flame, and the
Perlin noise algorithm is used to introduce variability to the flame’s
appearance.</p>
<p>To create the height map, we use the <code>create_height_map</code>
method, which generates a 2D grid of float values based on a sine-cosine
wave pattern. This pattern simulates elevation data that can be
influenced by time-dependent offsets. The resulting height map is then
used to construct a grid of vertices, where each vertex’s height is
influenced by multiple noise functions, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Base flame height</strong> from a Perlin noise
generator</li>
<li><strong>Turbulence</strong> for chaotic movement</li>
<li><strong>Detail noise</strong> for finer variations</li>
</ul>
<p>These noise functions work together to create a realistic and dynamic
flame shape. To ensure proper lighting and shading on the mesh, we
compute normals using height values from neighboring vertices.</p>
<p><strong>-&gt; Texture Application and Animation:</strong> <br></p>
<p>The flame texture is designed to reflect realistic flame colors and
is updated dynamically. We achieve this through:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Color Cycling</strong>: A set of predefined flame colors is
cycled through over time, creating a smooth animation. This is managed
in the <code>evolve</code> method of the flame actor, where a timer
tracks the interval between updates.</li>
<li><strong>Texture Mapping</strong>: The mesh vertices are assigned
texture coordinates, allowing the flame texture to wrap around the
procedural mesh correctly. This involves scaling and mapping coordinates
based on the vertex positions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>-&gt; Real-Time Updates and Flickering Behavior:</strong>
<br></p>
<p>To simulate the flickering behavior of real flames, we update the
mesh and texture of the flame in real-time. The
<code>initialize_flame</code> method initially creates the flame object
and establishes its dynamic properties. The
<code>update_flame_light</code> function tracks the maximum elevation of
the flame to adjust the position of light sources, creating a realistic
flickering effect.</p>
<p>The <code>evolve</code> function, called every frame, updates the
height map using sine and cosine functions to create animated motion. A
new flame mesh is then generated based on the modified height map,
ensuring that the visual representation appears organic and
responsive.</p>
<p>To maintain performance while still achieving visual realism, we used
a simple animated texture with color cycling instead of generating
complex procedural textures. The noise-based mesh already gave a
satisfying flame shape and motion, so the cycling colors were enough to
create the desired flame look without adding extra complexity.</p>
<h4 id="validation">Validation</h4>
<p>TODO</p>
<h3 id="feature-2-bloom-effect-shader">Feature 2 : Bloom Effect
Shader</h3>
<h4 id="implementation-1">Implementation</h4>
<p>A bloom effect was implemented using a fragment shader
(<code>bloom.frag.glsl</code>) to simulate light diffusion around
high-intensity areas. This effect is commonly used to approximate the
scattering of light in real-world optics and to improve visual clarity
of bright regions.</p>
<p><strong>-&gt; Brightness Detection and Thresholding:</strong>
<br></p>
<p>The shader samples color data from the scene texture and computes
luminance for each pixel using a weighted sum of the RGB components. A
brightness threshold (<code>u_brightness_threshold</code>) is applied to
determine which pixels are considered bright. Only these pixels are
selected for further processing to minimize computational overhead.</p>
<p><strong>-&gt; Gaussian Blur Application:</strong> <br></p>
<p>For pixels that exceed the threshold, a Gaussian blur is applied
using a two-dimensional kernel. The blur is performed by sampling
neighboring pixels within a defined radius (<code>u_blurRadius</code>).
Each sample is weighted by its distance from the center pixel using a
Gaussian distribution. This step approximates the light diffusion
typically observed around bright light sources.</p>
<p><strong>-&gt; Normalization and Final Composition:</strong> <br></p>
<p>After accumulating the blurred values, the result is normalized by
dividing by the sum of the sample weights. This prevents undesired
artifacts such as dimming or dark borders. The bloom contribution is
then added to the original pixel color, scaled by a user-defined factor
(<code>u_bloom_intensity</code>) to allow control over the effect’s
strength.</p>
<p><strong>-&gt; Dynamic Integration and User Controls:</strong>
<br></p>
<p>The bloom effect is integrated into the rendering pipeline and can be
toggled via user controls in real time.</p>
<h4 id="validation-1">Validation</h4>
<p>TODO</p>
<h3 id="feature-3-soft-shadows">Feature 3 : Soft Shadows</h3>
<h4 id="implementation-2">Implementation</h4>
<p>Soft shadow rendering is implemented using a combination of
Percentage Closer Filtering (PCF) and cube mapping. This approach
reduces hard shadow edges and produces more gradual light occlusion
transitions.</p>
<p><strong>-&gt; Cube Mapping for Shadow Capture:</strong> <br></p>
<p>To capture the necessary depth information for shadow determination,
the scene is rendered from the light source’s perspective using cube
mapping. This is handled by the <code>EnvironmentCapture</code> class,
which generates a cube map texture. The
<code>compute_shadow_cube_map</code> function manages this process,
capturing six views corresponding to each face of the cube. The
resulting cube map encodes depth values, enabling shadow visibility
calculations for fragments in all directions relative to the light
source.</p>
<p><strong>-&gt; Fragment Shader for Shadow Mapping:</strong> <br></p>
<p>In the fragment shader, each fragment’s world position is converted
into light space to determine its relationship to the light source. The
shader computes the direction vector from the fragment to the light, and
the distance between the two. These values are used to test shadow
visibility against the depth information stored in the cube map.</p>
<p><strong>-&gt; Poisson Disk Sampling:</strong> <br></p>
<p>To produce soft shadow edges, the shader applies Poisson disk
sampling with 16 offset vectors. These offsets are used to sample the
shadow map at slightly varied directions around the original light
vector. The offsets are scaled by a configurable
<code>shadow_softness</code> parameter to control the shadow blur
radius. This multi-sample approach helps reduce aliasing and creates
smoother shadow boundaries.</p>
<p><strong>-&gt; Shadow Testing:</strong> <br></p>
<p>For each Poisson disk sample, the shader retrieves the corresponding
depth from the cube shadow map and compares it to the fragment-to-light
distance. If the sampled depth is less than the actual distance, the
fragment is considered to be in shadow for that sample. This process is
repeated across all samples, with the results accumulated to compute
overall shadow intensity.</p>
<p><strong>-&gt; Averaging and Final Output:</strong> <br></p>
<p>The accumulated shadow values are averaged to generate the final
shadow factor. This averaging blends the transitions between fully lit
and fully shadowed regions, distinguishing soft shadows from hard-edged
shadows. The resulting shadow factor is used to adjust the fragment
color and lighting intensity. The system supports accumulation from
multiple light sources, ensuring consistent blending of shadow effects
across different illumination contributions.</p>

<h4 id="flame-generation-approach">Flame Generation Approach</h4>
<p>Although the original approach focused only on using procedurally
generated textures for the flame, it was later decided to also
incorporate a procedurally generated mesh. This combination provided
greater visual depth and contributed to a more dynamic and realistic
flame effect. For a more technical explanation, refer to <strong>Feature
1</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="failed-experiments">Failed Experiments</h3>
<p>Despite progress, two major issues with soft shadow rendering remain
unresolved.</p>
<h4 id="issues-in-soft-shadow-implementation">Issues in Soft Shadow
Implementation</h4>
<p>During the development of soft shadow rendering, two primary visual
issues were encountered. These affect the consistency and realism of
shadows across different lighting conditions and viewing angles.</p>
<p><strong>-&gt; 1. Inconsistent Shadow Rendering Near Light
Sources:</strong> <br></p>
<p>In some situations—especially around bright light sources like the
flame of the campfire and from certain camera angles—soft shadows were
missing or appeared unnaturally sharp. This led to inconsistent lighting
and a less realistic appearance.</p>
<p></br></p>
<div style="text-align:center; margin: 20px 0;">
<img src="images/failed_exp_circle.png" width="60%" />
<figcaption>
Figure: Missing soft shadows near the campfire light source.
</figcaption>
</div>
<p></br></p>
<p><strong>Potential Causes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cube Mapping Limitations</strong>: Fragments near the edges
of the cube map’s coverage may lack sufficient detail.</li>
<li><strong>Poisson Disk Sampling Variation</strong>: The shadow
softness depends on the sampling distribution, which may produce
inconsistent results depending on the view angle and location.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Potential Mitigation Strategies:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increased Sampling Resolution</strong>: More Poisson disk
samples can produce smoother shadow edges, at a higher computational
cost.</li>
<li><strong>Adjustable Shadow Softness</strong>: Dynamically modifying
the <code>shadow_softness</code> parameter, possibly based on distance
to the light source.</li>
<li><strong>Bias Optimization</strong>: Carefully adjusting the bias
used in depth comparisons to reduce shadow acne and artifacts.</li>
<li><strong>Hybrid Shadow Techniques</strong>: Mixing soft and hard
shadows to balance realism and detail near complex lighting
regions.</li>
<li><strong>Higher Cube Map Resolution</strong>: Improves detail capture
and helps reduce shadow loss near bright or complex surfaces.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>-&gt; 2. Artifacts at Greater Distances:</strong> <br></p>
<p>On distant terrain surfaces, especially in shadowed regions, visual
artifacts such as black lines were visible. These disrupted the visual
flow and were particularly noticeable in low-light conditions.</p>
<p></br></p>
<div style="text-align:center; margin: 20px 0;">
<img src="images/failed_exp_dark_lines.png" width="60%" />
<figcaption>
Figure: Black line artifacts appearing in distant shadows on terrain
surfaces.
</figcaption>
</div>
<p></br></p>
<p><strong>Potential Causes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Depth Precision Loss</strong>: Shadow map precision
decreases with distance, leading to inaccurate shadow results.</li>
<li><strong>Insufficient Sampling Coverage</strong>: Poisson disk
samples may not provide adequate variation at longer distances.</li>
<li><strong>Fixed Bias Limitations</strong>: A uniform bias does not
adapt well to varying fragment depths, resulting in incorrect
shadowing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Potential Solutions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Higher Shadow Map Resolution</strong>: Improves shadow
accuracy and reduces artifacts in large or distant surfaces.</li>
<li><strong>Distance-Based Biasing</strong>: Modifying bias based on
fragment distance to improve consistency across depth ranges.</li>
<li><strong>Post-Processing Filters</strong>: Applying blur or blending
filters during post-processing to smooth out hard lines or
discontinuities.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="challenges">Challenges</h3>
<p>Before settling on the final scene, we explored numerous different
approaches and had to backtrack several times. Here is a compilation of
some of the alternative methods and ideas that were tested but
ultimately set aside.</p>
<div
style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: center; gap: 20px;">
<div style="flex: 0 0 30%; text-align: center;">
<img src="images/failed_exp1.png" width="100%" />
<p>
Terrain generation using a weird height map created unstable and
exaggerated shapes that looked unrealistic.
</p>
</div>
<div style="flex: 0 0 30%; text-align: center;">
<img src="images/failed_exp2.png" width="100%" />
<p>
Another terrain attempt with an odd height map led to exaggerated shapes
that looked unrealistic.
</p>
</div>
<div style="flex: 0 0 30%; text-align: center;">
<img src="images/failed_exp3.png" width="100%" />
<p>
Incorrect bloom parameters resulted in overly bright highlights and loss
of visual detail.
</p>
</div>
<div style="flex: 0 0 30%; text-align: center;">
<img src="images/failed_exp4.png" width="100%" />
<p>
Sky brightness caused the bloom effect to be exaggerated, making the
upper part of the scene overly intense.
</p>
</div>
<div style="flex: 0 0 30%; text-align: center;">
<img src="images/failed_exp5.png" width="100%" />
<p>
Combining fire mesh from Blender* with dynamic properties lacked realism
and visual clarity.
</p>
</div>
<div style="flex: 0 0 30%; text-align: center;">
<img src="images/failed_exp6.png" width="100%" />
<p>
Procedural flame using noise produced awkward shapes that didn’t look
natural.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>* <em>We later replaced the Blender-created flame with a procedurally
generated mesh and applied a procedural texture on top, which better
captured the desired dynamic and natural appearance.</em></p>
<p>Despite the setbacks shown above, we were able to resolve all of them
through iterative improvements. We included these failed attempts in the
report as a trace of the development process and the challenges we faced
and overcame.</p>
